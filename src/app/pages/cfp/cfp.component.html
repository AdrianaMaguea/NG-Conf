It was a pleasure to be receiving all the proposals for talks and workshops and it is now our responsibility to study and evaluate them in order to select the best ones to offer attendees the best content and make ngConfCo 2020 the best online conference in Latin America.</p>
        <p i18n="@@CFP.Paragraph2">No matter the country our participants came from, their experience or mother tongue, all of them were welcome. We want to inspire as many people as possible around the world and that is the reason their participation and the energy they will give is so important to us. Remember: this time, our conference will be 100% virtual, and although it would be a pleasure having all of them here in our beautiful Medell√≠n, in this occassion, as a speaker they don't have to bother about traveling.</p>
        <p i18n="@@CFP.Paragraph3">If they were participating the very first time as speakers in a conference, we have a plan for them: a team of experts in public speaking will provide a guide step by step through the different preparation and start-up phases.</p>
